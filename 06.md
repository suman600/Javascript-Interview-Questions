# What is Hoisting?

When JavaScript code is run, it goes through **two main phases**:

1. **Memory Creation Phase**
2. **Code Execution Phase**

During the Memory Creation Phase, the JavaScript engine scans the code and creates memory placeholders for variables and functions.

This is called Hoisting — where declarations are moved to the top of their scope, allowing access before their actual line in code.

> ⚠️ Only **declarations** are hoisted, **not initializations**.

## ⚙️ How Hoisting Works

### 🧠 1. Memory Creation Phase
- The engine scans the code.
- Memory is allocated for variables and functions.
- Declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope.
- Initial values are **not assigned yet**, only placeholders are created.

#### 🔍 Behavior Based on Declaration Type

| Declaration Type     | Memory Allocated | Initial Value           | Access Before Declaration | Notes                         |
|----------------------|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `var`                | ✅ Yes           | `undefined`              | ✅ Allowed (gives `undefined`) | Hoisted and initialized       |
| `let` / `const`      | ✅ Yes           | ❌ Uninitialized (TDZ)   | ❌ ReferenceError          | Hoisted but not initialized   |
| Function Declaration | ✅ Yes           | ✅ Full function object   | ✅ Allowed                 | Fully hoisted with definition |
| Function Expression  | ⚠️ Only var part | `undefined`              | ❌ TypeError               | Not fully hoisted             |

---

### 🚀 2. Code Execution Phase
- JavaScript executes code line by line.
- Actual values are assigned to variables and functions.
- Accessing:
  - `var` before assignment → ✅ `undefined`
  - `let` / `const` before assignment → ❌ ReferenceError
  - Function declaration → ✅ Callable before definition
  - Function expression → ❌ TypeError if accessed before assignment

## 📘 Examples

### Example 1: `var` Hoisting

```js
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;
```

Internally:

```js
var a;         // Hoisted
console.log(a); // undefined
a = 10;         // Initialization
```

---

### Example 2: `let` and TDZ

```js
console.log(b); // ❌ ReferenceError
let b = 20;
```

> `b` is hoisted but not initialized, so it's in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).

---

### Example 3: Function Declaration

```js
sayHi(); // ✅ "Hello"

function sayHi() {
  console.log("Hello");
}
```

> Entire function is hoisted with its body.

---

### Example 4: Function Expression

```js
greet(); // ❌ TypeError: greet is not a function

var greet = function () {
  console.log("Hi");
};
```

> Only `var greet` is hoisted, initialized as `undefined`. The function itself is not hoisted.
