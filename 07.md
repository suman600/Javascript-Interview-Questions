# What is Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) in JavaScript?

The **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** is the period between the hoisting of a `let` or `const` variable and its actual declaration in the code, during which the variable **cannot be accessed**.

Accessing the variable in the TDZ will throw a **ReferenceError**, even though the variable has been hoisted.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why Does TDZ Happen?

- `let` and `const` are hoisted like `var`, but they are **not initialized** during the memory creation phase.
- Until the engine reaches the actual line where the variable is declared, the variable is in a **"dead zone"**.
- This ensures safer, more predictable behavior and avoids bugs from unintentional usage.

---

## üìò Example:

```js
console.log(a); // ‚ùå ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
let a = 10;
```

Here, `a` is hoisted, but it's not initialized, so it lives in the **TDZ** until `let a = 10;` is executed.

---

## üß† Key Points

- Applies to **`let`** and **`const`** (not `var`).
- Variable is in TDZ from start of scope until declaration is encountered.
- Accessing variable in TDZ = **ReferenceError**.
- Encourages better coding practices and prevents undefined behavior.
