# What is JavaScript?

**JavaScript** is a high-level, single-threaded, synchronous, interpreted programming language used to build dynamic and interactive web applications.  
It supports **asynchronous programming** using **callbacks**, **Promises**, and **`async/await`**.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features of JavaScript

- **Interpreted Language**  
  Executes code line-by-line without requiring compilation.

- **Single-Threaded**  
  Runs on a single call stack, handling one operation at a time.

- **Synchronous & Asynchronous Support**  
  Synchronous by default, but supports async programming with Promises and `async/await`.

- **Dynamic Typing**  
  Variable types are determined at runtime and can change dynamically.

- **First-Class Functions**  
  Functions are treated as valuesâ€”they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, or returned from other functions.

- **Prototype-Based Inheritance**  
  Uses prototypes instead of classical inheritance for object-oriented programming.

- **Event-Driven Architecture**  
  Responds to user actions and system events through listeners and handlers.

- **Closures**  
  Inner functions can access variables from their outer (lexical) scope even after the outer function has finished executing.

- **Cross-Platform**  
  Runs in all major browsers and on servers via Node.js.

- **Rich Ecosystem**  
  Offers a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue, Express).
