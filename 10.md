# **What is `undefined` and `null` in JavaScript?**

#### **Description**
Both `undefined` and `null` are special values in JavaScript, but they have distinct meanings:

- **`undefined`**:
    - This is the default value of a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value.
    - It indicates that a variable exists but hasn't been initialized with a value yet.

- **`null`**:
    - This is an **explicitly assigned value** indicating that a variable should have "no value."
    - It represents the intentional absence of any object value or data.

### **Key Differences Between `undefined` and `null`**

| Feature                | **`undefined`**                          | **`null`**                                |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Meaning**            | The absence of a value, indicating that a variable has been declared but not initialized. | Explicitly represents "no value" or "empty value." |
| **Type**               | `undefined` type.                       | `object` type (this is a known bug in JavaScript). |
| **Usage**              | Automatically assigned by JavaScript when variables are declared without a value. | Manually assigned by the developer when no value is intended. |
| **Equality (`==`)**    | `undefined == null` is `true` (loosely equal). | `undefined == null` is `true` (loosely equal). |
| **Equality (`===`)**   | `undefined === null` is `false` (strictly not equal). | `undefined === null` is `false` (strictly not equal). |

### **Examples**

#### **`undefined` Example**:

```js
let x;
console.log(x);
```

- **Explanation**: In this example, `x` is declared but not assigned any value, so its value is automatically set to **`undefined`** by JavaScript.

#### **`null` Example**:

```js
let y = null;
console.log(y);
```

- **Explanation**: Here, `y` is explicitly assigned **`null`** to signify that it has no value.
