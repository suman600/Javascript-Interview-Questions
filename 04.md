# ðŸ“˜ JavaScript Lexical Environment

## What is a Lexical Environment?

A **Lexical Environment** is an internal structure used by the JavaScript engine to **manage scope and variable access** during code execution.

It consists of:
- **Environment Record** â€“ stores variables and functions defined in the current scope.
- **Outer Reference** â€“ a link to the parent Lexical Environment (for scope chaining).

JavaScript uses **lexical (static) scoping**, meaning scope is determined by the position of code in the source file.

## ðŸ”¢ Types of Lexical Environments

### 1. Global Lexical Environment
- Created when the script starts.
- Stores global variables and functions.
- Outer reference is `null`.

### 2. Local Lexical Environment
- Created when a function is called or a block is entered.
- Stores local variables, parameters, and inner declarations.
- Has a reference to its outer (parent) environment.

```js
let a = 1;

function outer() {
  let b = 2;

  function inner() {
    let c = 3;
    console.log(a, b, c); // Output: 1 2 3
  }

  inner();
}

outer();
