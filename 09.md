# What is Pass by Value and Pass by Reference?

In JavaScript, when values are passed to functions or assigned to variables, they can be passed in two ways:
- **Pass by Value**: The **actual value** is copied and passed to the function or variable. Any changes to the copy do not affect the original variable.
- **Pass by Reference**: A **reference (memory address)** to the value is passed. Changes made to the reference will directly affect the original value.

#### **Difference Between Pass by Value and Pass by Reference**
- **Pass by Value**: Used with **primitive data types** like `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`, and `bigint`.
- **Pass by Reference**: Used with **non-primitive (reference) types** like `objects`, `arrays`, and `functions`.

#### **Examples**

**Pass by Value** (Primitive types):
```js
let x = 10;
let y = x;   // y gets a copy of x's value
y = 20;
console.log(x);  // 10 (x is unchanged)
console.log(y);  // 20 (y is changed)
```

**Pass by Reference** (Non-primitive types):
```js
let obj1 = { name: "Alice" };
let obj2 = obj1;  // obj2 holds a reference to obj1
obj2.name = "Bob";
console.log(obj1.name);  // "Bob" (obj1 is changed because obj2 references the same object)
console.log(obj2.name);  // "Bob"
```
